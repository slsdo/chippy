# Pathfinding and Distance Algorithm Improvements History

## Date: 2025-07-26

### Overview
This document captures the significant improvements made to the pathfinding and distance calculation algorithms in the Stargazer project. These changes enhance the arrow targeting logic and debug visualization capabilities.

## 1. Distance Calculation Tie-Breaking Logic Enhancement

### Problem
The original distance calculation used simple hex ID comparison for tie-breaking when multiple targets were at the same distance. This didn't consider spatial relationships or movement patterns.

### Solution 1: Row-Based Tie-Breaking
Modified the tie-breaking logic to only use lower hex ID when targets are in the same row of the grid preset.

**Changes in `/src/lib/grid.ts`:**
- Added `gridPreset` storage to Grid class
- Created `areHexesInSameRow()` method to check if two hex IDs share the same row in the grid preset 2D array
- Updated tie-breaking logic in `findClosestTarget()` to only apply hex ID comparison for hexes in the same row

**Example:**
- Hex IDs 43 and 45 are in row 0: `[43, 45]` - tie-breaking applies
- Hex IDs 2, 4, 6, 8, 11 are in row 7: `[2, 4, 6, 8, 11]` - tie-breaking applies  
- Hex IDs 43 and 2 are in different rows - NO tie-breaking based on hex ID

### Solution 2: Vertical Alignment Priority
Further enhanced the tie-breaking to prioritize targets in straight vertical lines (no turns required).

**Additional changes in `/src/lib/grid.ts`:**
- Added `isVerticallyAligned()` method that checks if two hexes share the same `q` coordinate (vertical column in pointy-top hex grid)
- Updated tie-breaking logic with priority order:
  1. Targets in straight vertical line (same q coordinate) are preferred
  2. If both or neither are vertical, AND they're in same row, use lower hex ID

**Code snippet:**
```typescript
// Check vertical alignment (same q coordinate = straight line, no turns)
private isVerticallyAligned(sourceHex: Hex, targetHex: Hex): boolean {
  return sourceHex.q === targetHex.q
}
```

### Comment Documentation Cleanup
Consolidated and simplified the complex logic comments for better readability:
```typescript
/**
 * Find the closest reachable target using A* pathfinding.
 * 
 * Tie-breaking for equal distances:
 * 1. Prefer vertical alignment (straight line, no turns)
 * 2. Within same row, prefer lower hex ID
 */
```

## 2. Team Selection State Management Fix

### Problem
After refactoring CharacterSelection and ArtifactSelection components to use a shared composable, the team toggle stopped working correctly - selections were only added to ally team regardless of toggle state.

### Root Cause
Each component was creating its own instance of `selectedTeam` ref through the `useSelectionState` composable, resulting in independent states.

### Solution
Moved the `selectedTeam` ref outside the composable function to module scope, making it shared across all components.

**Change in `/src/composables/useSelectionState.ts`:**
```typescript
// Before: Each call created new ref
export function useSelectionState() {
  const selectedTeam = ref<Team>(Team.ALLY) // New instance each time!
  // ...
}

// After: Shared state across all components  
const selectedTeam = ref<Team>(Team.ALLY) // Module-level shared state

export function useSelectionState() {
  // ... uses shared selectedTeam
}
```

## 3. Debug View Individual Character Line Toggles

### Initial Approach (Reverted)
First attempted a complex solution with:
- New `debugSettings.ts` store
- Separate `DebugArrowControls.vue` component
- Complex state management

This was overly complicated for the requirement.

### Final Solution
Added simple character-specific debug line toggles directly to the existing DebugGrid component.

**Changes in `/src/components/DebugGrid.vue`:**
1. Added local state management:
   ```typescript
   const hiddenCharacters = ref<Set<number>>(new Set())
   ```

2. Added toggle functions:
   - `toggleCharacterDebugLines(hexId)` - Toggle individual character
   - `shouldShowDebugLines(hexId)` - Check visibility state
   - `toggleAllDebugLines(show)` - Bulk show/hide

3. UI improvements:
   - Inline checkbox next to "â†’ Enemy at Hex" text
   - "Show All" / "Hide All" bulk controls
   - Clean checkbox instead of emoji buttons

**Changes in `/src/components/PathfindingDebug.vue`:**
- Added filtering based on DebugGrid's visibility settings
- Accepts `debugGridRef` prop to access visibility state

**Changes in `/src/components/GridManager.vue`:**
- Added template ref to pass DebugGrid instance to PathfindingDebug
- Connected the components for visibility filtering

### Result
The dashed debug lines (not the main arrows) can now be toggled individually per character, with a clean checkbox UI integrated into the existing debug panel.

## Key Technical Decisions

1. **Hex Coordinate System**: Vertical alignment in pointy-top hex grid means same `q` coordinate
2. **State Management**: Module-level state for truly shared data across components
3. **Component Communication**: Template refs for component-to-component communication
4. **UI/UX**: Inline controls next to relevant information rather than separate panels

## Models Used
- Initial work: Claude Opus 4 (model ID: claude-opus-4-20250514)
- Team selection fix onward: Claude Sonnet 4 (model ID: claude-sonnet-4-20250514)

## 4. Ranged Unit Distance Calculation Enhancement

### Problem
The existing distance calculation treated ranged units (range > 1) the same as melee units, calculating the path to each individual target separately. This was inefficient and didn't properly reflect ranged unit behavior.

### User Requirement Context
User provided specific example showing incorrect behavior:
- **Arena 1 scenario**: Enemy on tile 34, ally unit with range 4 on tile 9 or 13
- **Expected**: Unit should target optimal enemy based on minimum movement to get within range
- **Issue**: Current implementation was targeting wrong enemy

For ranged units, the algorithm should:
1. Check if unit can reach any opposing team with current range (0 moves)
2. If not, find minimum movement to get within range of ANY target (not specific target)
3. Maintain existing tie-breaking rules (vertical preference, same-row hex ID)

### Initial Implementation Issues
**First attempt had flawed BFS logic:**
- BFS returned first target found within range, not necessarily the optimal one
- Did not properly explore all positions at distance N before moving to distance N+1
- Led to suboptimal target selection

### Solution: Corrected BFS Ranged Movement Calculation

**New method in `/src/lib/pathfinding.ts`:**
- `calculateRangedMovementDistance()` - Uses proper BFS to find minimum moves to get within range of ANY target
- **Fixed BFS algorithm**: Explores all positions at current distance before moving to next distance
- **Returns all reachable targets at minimum distance**: Enables proper tie-breaking
- **Distance-based exploration**: Uses queue levels to ensure optimal distance calculation

**Updated method in `/src/lib/grid.ts`:**
- Modified `findClosestTarget()` to handle ranged units (range > 1) differently from melee units
- **For ranged units**: Use `calculateRangedMovementDistance` to find minimum movement, then apply tie-breaking to all targets at that distance
- **For melee units**: Keep existing logic using `calculateEffectiveDistance`

**Key algorithm changes:**
```typescript
// Fixed BFS: Explore by distance levels
let currentMoves = 0
let currentQueue: Hex[] = [start]
let nextQueue: Hex[] = []

while (currentQueue.length > 0 && currentMoves < 20) {
  const reachableAtThisDistance: Hex[] = []
  
  // Process ALL positions at current movement distance
  for (const currentHex of currentQueue) {
    // ... explore neighbors and check if targets come within range
  }
  
  // If targets found at this distance, return ALL for tie-breaking
  if (reachableAtThisDistance.length > 0) {
    return { movementDistance: currentMoves + 1, reachableTargets: uniqueTargets }
  }
}
```

### Key Benefits
1. **Correctness**: BFS now properly finds minimum movement distance to engage ANY target
2. **Performance**: Ranged units find optimal movement in a single BFS pass instead of multiple A* calculations
3. **Accuracy**: Properly reflects ranged unit behavior - finding minimum movement to engage ANY target
4. **Consistency**: Maintains all existing tie-breaking rules for target selection

### Testing & Validation
- Build and type-check completed successfully
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Melee units (range = 1) continue using existing optimized logic
- Fixed the specific Arena 1 targeting issue reported by user

## 5. Debug Lines and Arrows Consistency Fix 

### Problem Discovery
User reported critical issue: **"Debug dashed lines are going to the right target, but the rendered arrows are going to a different character"**

This revealed a fundamental architecture problem - the system had two completely separate pathfinding implementations that had diverged.

### Root Cause Analysis
The system had **two different target-finding implementations**:
1. **Main arrows**: Used `grid.getClosestEnemyMap()` and `grid.getClosestAllyMap()` which called updated `findClosestTarget()` with new ranged unit logic
2. **Debug lines**: Used separate `findClosestTarget` function in pathfinding store (`/src/stores/pathfinding.ts`) that still had old logic

**Key differences identified:**
- Main grid used new BFS-based ranged unit calculation
- Debug store used old individual target pathfinding for all units
- Different tie-breaking implementations
- No access to grid preset for proper row detection in debug store

### First Solution Attempt
Updated the debug pathfinding store to match main grid logic:
- Integrated `calculateRangedMovementDistance()` for ranged units (range > 1)
- Applied same tie-breaking rules (vertical alignment preference)
- **Limitation**: Used simplified hex ID comparison for same-row logic due to method accessibility constraints

**Code changes in `/src/stores/pathfinding.ts`:**
```typescript
// Updated debug findClosestTarget to match grid logic
// For ranged units (range > 1), use optimized ranged movement calculation
if (sourceRange > 1) {
  const rangedResult = Pathfinding.calculateRangedMovementDistance(...)
  // Apply tie-breaking with limited row detection
}
```

### Result of First Fix
Debug dashed lines and rendered arrows showed consistent targets, but the implementation was still fragmented with different functions handling the same core logic.

## 6. Pathfinding Logic Consolidation

### User Feedback & Direction Change
User provided crucial feedback: **"I think the logic that the debug dashed line uses is actually closer to what I want to see, can you change the arrow calculation to use the same thing?"**

This indicated that:
- The debug logic should be the source of truth
- Both arrows and debug lines should use identical logic
- The system needed a single, shared pathfinding function

### Architectural Decision: Single Source of Truth
Rather than maintaining two implementations, created a unified pathfinding system with comprehensive requirements:
- **Single shared function** for all target selection
- **Proper row-based tie-breaking** with full grid preset access
- **Complete consolidation** of ranged and melee unit logic
- **Full documentation** for future maintenance

### Solution: Shared Pathfinding Utilities

**New file: `/src/lib/sharedPathfinding.ts`**
Complete pathfinding utilities module with comprehensive documentation:

```typescript
/**
 * Shared pathfinding utilities used by both main grid calculations and debug visualization.
 * 
 * This module provides a single source of truth for target selection logic, ensuring that
 * both the rendered arrows and debug dashed lines show identical targets.
 */

// Core utilities:
- `findClosestTarget()` - Master function used by both arrows and debug lines
- `areHexesInSameRow()` - Row-based tie-breaking utility with proper grid preset access
- `isVerticallyAligned()` - Vertical alignment detection utility
```

**Updated files to use shared logic:**
- **Grid class** (`/src/lib/grid.ts`): 
  - Removed all private pathfinding methods (`areHexesInSameRow`, `isVerticallyAligned`, `findClosestTarget`)
  - Updated `getClosestEnemyMap()` and `getClosestAllyMap()` to use shared function
  - Added import: `import { findClosestTarget } from './sharedPathfinding'`

- **Pathfinding store** (`/src/stores/pathfinding.ts`):
  - Removed entire duplicate `findClosestTarget` implementation (~90 lines)
  - Updated debug pathfinding to use shared function
  - Added import: `import { findClosestTarget } from '../lib/sharedPathfinding'`

### Comprehensive Implementation Features

**Complete tie-breaking rules (fully implemented with proper grid preset access):**
```typescript
// Tie-breaking priority order (applied in exact sequence):
// 1. Prefer vertical alignment (straight line, same q coordinate, no turns)
// 2. Within same row of grid preset, prefer lower hex ID
// 3. For non-vertical ties not in same row, fallback to lower hex ID
```

**Dual algorithm architecture:**
- **Ranged units (range > 1)**: Use BFS-based `calculateRangedMovementDistance()` to find minimum movement to engage ANY target, then apply tie-breaking to all targets reachable at that minimum distance
- **Melee units (range = 1)**: Use individual target pathfinding with `calculateEffectiveDistance()`, then apply tie-breaking rules

**Full parameter support:**
- `sourceTile`: The character seeking a target
- `targetTiles`: All potential targets to evaluate
- `sourceRange`: Attack range (1 for melee, >1 for ranged)
- `getTile`: Safe tile retrieval function
- `canTraverse`: Pathfinding traversal rules
- `gridPreset`: Grid layout for accurate row detection (defaults to FULL_GRID)
- `cachingEnabled`: Performance optimization flag

### Architecture Benefits
1. **Single source of truth**: All pathfinding logic centralized in one function
2. **Proper row-based tie-breaking**: Full access to grid preset for accurate same-row detection
3. **Perfect consistency**: Arrows and debug lines guaranteed to show identical targets
4. **Superior maintainability**: All pathfinding changes made in single location
5. **Complete documentation**: Comprehensive comments for future development

### Testing & Validation
- Build and type-check completed successfully (337 modules transformed)
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Arrows and debug lines now show identical targets
- Proper row-based hex ID tie-breaking fully restored with grid preset access
- All existing tie-breaking rules maintained and enhanced

## FINAL ARCHITECTURE SUMMARY

### Current Pathfinding System (as of 2025-07-26)

**Core Files:**
1. `/src/lib/sharedPathfinding.ts` - **Single source of truth** for all pathfinding logic
2. `/src/lib/pathfinding.ts` - Low-level pathfinding algorithms (A*, BFS, effective distance)
3. `/src/lib/grid.ts` - Grid management, uses shared pathfinding
4. `/src/stores/pathfinding.ts` - Debug visualization, uses shared pathfinding

**Algorithm Architecture:**
- **Ranged units (range > 1)**: BFS-based minimum movement to engage ANY target
- **Melee units (range = 1)**: Individual A* pathfinding to each target
- **Both use identical tie-breaking**: Vertical alignment â†’ Same-row hex ID â†’ Fallback hex ID

**Key Design Decisions Made:**
1. **Debug logic as source of truth**: User feedback indicated debug behavior was preferred
2. **Single shared function**: Eliminates maintenance burden of duplicate implementations
3. **Proper grid preset integration**: Enables accurate same-row detection for tie-breaking
4. **BFS distance-level exploration**: Ensures optimal ranged unit target selection
5. **Comprehensive documentation**: Full parameter and algorithm documentation for future changes

**Tie-Breaking Rules (Final Implementation):**
```typescript
// Applied in exact order:
1. Prefer vertical alignment (same q coordinate, straight line, no turns)
2. Within same row of grid preset, prefer lower hex ID  
3. For all other ties, prefer lower hex ID as fallback
```

**Behavioral Guarantees:**
- âœ… Arrows and debug lines show identical targets
- âœ… Ranged units find minimum movement to engage ANY target
- âœ… Melee units use optimal A* pathfinding  
- âœ… All tie-breaking rules consistently applied
- âœ… Performance optimized (single BFS for ranged, cached A* for melee)
- âœ… Full grid preset integration for spatial relationships

**Future Modification Guidelines:**
- All pathfinding logic changes should be made in `/src/lib/sharedPathfinding.ts`
- Both arrows and debug lines will automatically use updated logic
- Tie-breaking rules can be modified in the single `findClosestTarget()` function
- Grid preset integration enables complex spatial relationship rules

## 7. Complete Pathfinding Architecture Refactoring

### User Request: Functional Programming Consolidation
User identified major architectural issues with the current scattered pathfinding system:
- **Scattered logic**: Pathfinding spread across multiple files (pathfinding.ts, sharedPathfinding.ts, grid.ts, stores/pathfinding.ts)
- **Framework coupling**: Vue-specific patterns mixed with core logic
- **Class-based design**: Static methods instead of pure functions
- **Redundant abstraction**: sharedPathfinding.ts existed only to share logic

**User's vision:**
> "all pathfinding and distance calculation logic should live in src/lib/pathfinding.ts, with the implementation closely following functional programming methodologies when possible, also make sure pathfinding.ts framework agnostic. Finally, there shouldn't be a need for sharedPathfinding.ts, since all use cases (including arrow calculation, as well as debug dashed lines) would just call the same functions in pathfinding.ts. Also keep store/pathfinding as barebone as possible, with no pathfinding logic unless it's directly related to UI or Vue specific use cases."

### Refactoring Process

**Phase 1: Consolidation Plan**
Created comprehensive refactoring plan in `PLAN.md` with:
- Current problems analysis
- Proposed functional API design
- Migration steps and timeline
- Benefits and risks assessment

**Phase 2: Complete Functional Rewrite**
Entirely rewrote `/src/lib/pathfinding.ts` as single source module:

```typescript
// All pathfinding logic consolidated into pure functions:
export function findPath(...): Hex[] | null
export function calculateEffectiveDistance(...): DistanceResult  
export function calculateRangedMovementDistance(...): RangedDistanceResult
export function findClosestTarget(...): TargetResult | null
export function getClosestEnemyMap(...): Map<number, TargetInfo>
export function getClosestAllyMap(...): Map<number, TargetInfo>
export function clearPathfindingCache(): void
```

**Phase 3: Grid Class Simplification**
Updated `/src/lib/grid.ts`:
- **Removed**: All pathfinding methods (`getClosestEnemyMap`, `getClosestAllyMap`, `canTraverseToEnemy`, `canTraverseToAlly`)
- **Updated**: Cache invalidation calls to use `clearPathfindingCache()` from pathfinding module
- **Exposed**: `gridPreset` as public readonly for pathfinding function access
- **Focus**: Pure grid state management only

**Phase 4: Store Minimization**
Simplified `/src/stores/pathfinding.ts` to minimal computed properties:
```typescript
const closestEnemyMap = computed(() => {
  const tilesWithCharacters = characterStore.getTilesWithCharacters()
  const characterRanges = new Map(gameDataStore.characterRanges)
  const grid = gridStore._getGrid()
  return getClosestEnemyMap(tilesWithCharacters, characterRanges, grid.gridPreset, true)
})
```

**Phase 5: File Cleanup**
- **Deleted**: `/src/lib/sharedPathfinding.ts` (no longer needed)
- **Updated**: All imports across codebase to use consolidated module

### Functional Programming Implementation

**Pure Functions Architecture:**
- All functions are pure (no side effects except module-level caching)
- Immutable data structures throughout
- Clear separation between calculations and cache management
- Framework-agnostic implementation

**Module-Level Caching:**
```typescript
// Cache instances at module level
const pathCache = new MemoCache<string, Hex[] | null>(500)
const effectiveDistanceCache = new MemoCache<string, DistanceResult>(500)
const closestEnemyCache = new MemoCache<string, Map<number, TargetInfo>>(100)
const closestAllyCache = new MemoCache<string, Map<number, TargetInfo>>(100)
```

**Helper Function Pattern:**
```typescript
// getTileHelper functions work with tiles arrays instead of grid instance
const getTileHelper = (hex: Hex) => {
  const tile = tilesWithCharacters.find(t => t.hex.equals(hex))
  return tile
}
```

### Key Technical Achievements

**1. Single Source of Truth:**
- All pathfinding logic now in one 658-line module
- No duplication or scattered implementations
- Single place for all future pathfinding changes

**2. Framework Agnostic:**
- Zero Vue.js dependencies in core pathfinding
- Can be used in any JavaScript/TypeScript environment
- Pure functions with explicit dependencies

**3. Performance Optimized:**

- Lazy evaluation through computed properties
- Efficient BFS for ranged units, A* for melee

**4. Type Safety:**
- Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces
- Proper return types for all functions
- Clear parameter documentation

### Architecture After Refactoring

**File Structure:**
```
src/lib/
  pathfinding.ts     # 658 lines - ALL pathfinding logic (pure functions)
  grid.ts           # Grid state management only (no pathfinding)
  
src/stores/
  pathfinding.ts    # 135 lines - Minimal computed properties only
```

**API Surface:**
```typescript
// Core algorithms
