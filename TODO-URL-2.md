## 1. **Binary Encoding Instead of Base64**

- Base64 uses 6 bits per character, but you can use more efficient encodings
- Consider Base85/ASCII85 (uses 85 printable characters) - about 20% more efficient than Base64
- Or use a custom Base92 encoding with URL-safe characters for maximum density

## 2. **Data Structure Optimization**

- **Positional encoding**: Instead of storing full coordinates, use a single number for hex positions (0-N where N is total hexes)
- **Character IDs**: Use short numeric IDs (0-255) instead of strings
- **Bit packing**: Pack multiple small values into single bytes
  - Character ID: 8 bits
  - Position: 6-7 bits (for typical hex grids)
  - Team/faction: 2-3 bits
  - Status flags: remaining bits

## 3. **Dictionary/Lookup Tables**

- Create a fixed dictionary of common character combinations
- Store just an index to common team compositions
- Use Huffman coding for frequently used characters

## 4. **Delta Encoding**

- Store only differences from a "default" state
- If most hexes are empty, only encode occupied positions
- Use run-length encoding for consecutive empty spaces

## 5. **Compression**

- Apply DEFLATE/zlib compression before encoding
- Libraries like `pako` can compress in browser
- Can reduce size by 50-70% for repetitive data

## 6. **URL Shortener Service**

- Store full state server-side with a short ID
- Generate tiny URLs (6-8 characters)
- Can use services like Firebase Dynamic Links or custom solution

## 7. **Hybrid Approach**

```javascript
// Example implementation
function compressState(gameState) {
  // 1. Convert to minimal representation
  const minimal = {
    m: gameState.mapId, // map as single char/number
    c: gameState.characters.map((char) => ({
      i: char.id, // numeric ID
      p: char.position, // single number
      t: char.team, // 0 or 1
    })),
  }

  // 2. Pack into binary
  const buffer = packBinary(minimal)

  // 3. Compress
  const compressed = pako.deflate(buffer)

  // 4. Encode efficiently
  return base85.encode(compressed)
}
```

## 8. **Progressive Loading**

- Split data into essential (positions) and optional (cosmetic) parts
- Load detailed character data from game files after URL load
- URL only needs character ID and position

## Implementation Priority:

1. Start with positional encoding and numeric IDs
2. Add zlib compression (biggest win for effort)
3. Switch to Base85 encoding
4. Implement bit packing for further gains

These optimizations combined could reduce your URLs from 200-300 characters to potentially 50-100 characters, depending on the complexity of your game state.
